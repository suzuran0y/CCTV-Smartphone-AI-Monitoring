## 1. Project Overview [⌃](#top)

<a id="sec11"></a>

### 1.1. Positioning [⌃](#top)

The Sentinel system consists of a PC-side server, a Web Dashboard, and an optional AI monitoring module.  
CamFlow acts as the mobile data acquisition client, responsible for capturing real-time camera frames from the smartphone and uploading them to the PC server at a stable and controllable rate. These frames serve as the raw data input for real-time preview, recording, and event analysis.

The project follows a **layered architecture design: Mobile Input → PC Processing & Management**.

In the overall system architecture, the current version of CamFlow is responsible for:

- Camera capture
- JPEG encoding
- Network transmission
- Server discovery & connection state indication
- Runtime mode control (hide preview / stop capture)

All other functionalities — such as video recording, event detection, and AI inference — are handled by the PC-side server.  
This separation reduces complexity on the mobile device and improves maintainability.

CamFlow and the PC server together form the complete Sentinel system:

- 📱 **Android Client** — Responsible for image capture and upload  
- 🖥 **PC Server** — Responsible for video processing, recording, AI analysis, and visualization  

> 📘 For the complete system architecture and deployment instructions, please refer to: 👉 **[Sentinel Main System Guide](README.md)**

### 1.2. Feature Overview [⌃](#top)

CamFlow provides the following core functionalities:

---

#### 1. Real-time Camera Capture & Transmission

- Capture frames using the Android camera;
- Encode each frame into JPEG format;
- Upload frames to the PC server via HTTP (`/upload` endpoint).

---

#### 2. Automatic Server Discovery

- Attempt to discover available Sentinel PC servers via UDP broadcast within the local network (LAN);
- If discovery fails, automatically fall back to manual server address input.

---

#### 3. Connection Testing & Status Visualization

- Display real-time connection status (`Status` / `Server`);
- Provide a **Test connection** button in the Settings page to quickly verify server reachability (typically via `/ping`).

---

#### 4. Runtime Controls & Deployment Flexibility

- **Show debug info**  
  Display runtime debug information (useful for on-site deployment and connection diagnostics).

- **Hide camera preview**  
  Hide the camera preview (black screen) while continuing to upload frames.  
  Useful for privacy-sensitive or discreet deployment scenarios.

- **Stop camera**  
  Stop both camera capture and frame upload.  
  Useful for power saving or temporarily pausing input.

---

<a id="sec22"></a>

### 2.2. Connecting to Server [⌃](#top)

#### 2.2.1. Auto Discovery

If CamFlow does not have a configured server address, it will attempt to automatically discover a Sentinel server within the local network.

During this process, the status will display: `Discovering server...`


If discovery succeeds:

- CamFlow will automatically populate the server address;
- The application will enter a connectable / upload-ready state.

Depending on the network environment, the app may:
- Connect directly, or  
- Require user confirmation to save the discovered address.

---

#### 2.2.2. Manual Input

If automatic discovery fails, CamFlow will display a prompt dialog (see Figure 2) requesting manual server input.

Prompt explanation and input format:

- **Connection failed / Could not find the server automatically**
  - Indicates that no UDP discovery response was received.

- **Enter IP address**
  - Input the server IP address.
  - If using a non-default port, append the port number.

Format examples:

- `192.168.1.10`  
 (Default port will be automatically appended — typically `8000`.)

- `192.168.1.10:xxxx`  
  (Explicitly specify the port.)

- **Connect**
  - Performs a connection test.
  - If the Dashboard still does not display video after connection:
    - Ensure **Ingest** is enabled on the PC Dashboard.
    - Verify firewall and port accessibility.

---

<a id="sec23"></a>

### 2.3. Settings Page [⌃](#top)

Tap the **top-right corner** of the main interface to enter the Settings page (see Figure 3).  
Here you can configure the server address, test connectivity, and control runtime switches.

---

#### Settings Page Fields & Function Description

| Field | Type | Format | Description |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| Server address | Text input | IPv4 or IPv4:Port | Specify the target server address for manual connection |

---

| Button | Trigger | Result | Description |
|--------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Auto discover | Click | Trigger one discovery process | Broadcast within LAN to search for available server |
| Test connection | Click | Success / Failure | Send a reachability test request to server (typically `/ping`) |
| Save | Click | Save successful | Save current server address and settings |

---

| Switch | State | System Behavior | Design Purpose |
|--------|-------|----------------|----------------|
| Show debug info | ON / OFF | Display debug information on main screen | Assist deployment & diagnostics |
| Hide camera preview | ON / OFF | Hide camera preview but continue uploading | Reduce visual exposure / minimize disturbance |
| Stop camera | ON / OFF | Stop capture and upload | Power saving / temporary pause |

> When **Stop camera = ON**, the system will automatically enable *Hide preview* to prevent residual image display.

---

<a id="sec24"></a>

### 2.4. Usage Steps [⌃](#top)

#### 2.4.1. Prerequisites

Before using CamFlow, ensure the following conditions are met:

- **Project deployed locally**: The Sentinel repository has been cloned to the PC;
- **Same LAN**: The smartphone and PC server are connected to the same Wi-Fi / LAN;
- **PC server running**: The Sentinel PC-side service is accessible from the phone;
- **Firewall & port allowed**: Default port is `8000` (unless modified). Ensure the PC firewall allows inbound access from the phone.

---

#### 2.4.2. Deployment Workflow

1. **Start the Sentinel PC server**;
2. Upon successful startup, the terminal will output the server IP address in the form:  `<PC_IP>:<PORT>`;
3. On the phone browser, access:  `http://<PC_IP>:<PORT>/ping`; If the response is `OK`, the server is running correctly;
4. Ensure the phone and PC are connected to the **same Wi-Fi network**;
5. Open CamFlow and wait for automatic discovery;
6. If discovery succeeds, the server address will be auto-filled and connection established;
7. If discovery fails, manually enter the IP address in the popup dialog;
8. Verify that `Status` changes to `Connected`;
9. Once connected, tap the top-right corner to enter the Settings page if configuration adjustments are needed;
10. Open the PC-side Dashboard using: `http://<PC_IP>:<PORT>/`; 
11. Click the `Enable Ingest` button to allow the server to receive frames;
12. Once the **Live View** window updates with the camera feed, CamFlow is successfully running.

---

At this point, the CamFlow service and its data transmission to the PC server are fully operational.

## 3. FAQ [⌃](#top)

<details>

<summary><strong>Auto discovery failed (Cannot find server automatically)</strong></summary>

- Status displays `Discovering server...` and eventually fails;
- A popup appears: “Could not find the server automatically”.

### Possible Causes

1. The phone and PC are not on the same LAN.
2. The router has AP isolation enabled, preventing device-to-device communication.
3. Network policies or device restrictions block UDP broadcast.
4. The PC server is not running the discovery responder or the UDP port is blocked.

### Troubleshooting Steps

1. On the phone browser, visit: `http://<PC_IP>:<PORT>/ping`

- If accessible → TCP connectivity is normal. Use manual input instead.
- If not accessible → Check firewall, port configuration, or network isolation.

2. Try manually entering `PC_IP:PORT` in the app and click **Test connection**.

### Solutions

- Use **Manual Input** as a stable alternative;
- Disable AP isolation on the router;
- Allow the required TCP port (e.g., 8000) and UDP discovery port in the PC firewall.

</details>

---

<details>

<summary><strong>Test connection failed (/ping unreachable)</strong></summary>

- Clicking **Test connection** in Settings shows failure or no response.

### Possible Causes

1. Incorrect server IP or port;
2. PC server not running or listening on a different port;
3. Firewall blocking incoming connections;
4. Phone not connected to Wi-Fi.

### Troubleshooting Steps

1. Ensure the phone and PC are on the same Wi-Fi network;
2. On the phone browser, visit: `http://<PC_IP>:<PORT>/ping`
- If accessible → TCP connectivity is normal.
- If not accessible → Check firewall, port configuration, or network isolation.

### Solutions

- Correct the IP/port;
- Allow the configured TCP port (and UDP discovery port if used) in the PC firewall.

</details>

---

<details>

<summary><strong>CamFlow shows Connected, but Dashboard has no video</strong></summary>

- Phone status indicates connected;
- PC Dashboard Live View does not update.

### Possible Causes

1. The settings on the settings page have not been updated.
2. **Ingest** is not enabled on the PC Dashboard (receiving switch is OFF);
3. Upload endpoint path or field name mismatch (e.g., server expects `image` but client sends differently);
4. Upload succeeds but frames are rate-limited or dropped on server side (check logs);
5. Browser cache or page not refreshed.

### Troubleshooting Steps

1. Check whether `/upload` requests are received on the PC server;
2. Refresh the Dashboard page and verify **Ingest** status;
3. Reduce sending load by increasing `Interval` (e.g., 200–300ms) to test stability.

### Solutions

- Click on the upper right corner to enter the settings page and update the settings once；
- Ensure **Ingest** is enabled;
- Align client/server API contract (path, field name, port);
- Adjust sending interval, resolution, or JPEG quality to match network and PC performance.

</details>

---

<details>

<summary><strong>APK installation blocked or marked unsafe</strong></summary>

- System shows “Installation blocked” or “Unknown source not allowed”.

### Solutions

- Enable installation from unknown sources in system settings;
- Ensure the APK is downloaded from the official GitHub Releases page, not from third-party redistribution.

### 4.2. API Reference [⌃](#top)

#### 4.2.1. Base Contract

- **Base URL**: `http://<PC_IP>:<PORT>`
- **Default Port**: Determined by PC server startup parameters (default: `8000`)
- **Transport Protocol**: HTTP (plaintext; recommended for LAN use only)
- **Client Upload Field Name**: `image`

---

#### 4.2.2. Health Check Endpoint: `GET /ping`

Used by CamFlow Settings page via **Test connection**.

Purpose:
- Distinguish between network connectivity issues and application-level errors.

**Request**

- Method: `GET`
- Path: `/ping`
- Body: None

**Response**

- Status: `200 OK`
- Body: `OK`
- Timeout, connection error, or non-200 status code → considered failure.

**curl Example**

```bash
curl -i "http://<PC_IP>:<PORT>/ping"
```

#### 4.2.3. Frame Upload Endpoint: `POST /upload`

CamFlow continuously uploads image data to the server in the form of **single-frame JPEG images**.

After receiving the request, the server:

- Decodes the image bytes;
- Writes the frame into `FrameBuffer`;
- Makes it available to `/stream` and downstream modules (Recorder / AI Monitor).

---

**Request**

- Method: `POST`
- Path: `/upload`
- Content-Type: `multipart/form-data`

| Field Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------------|------|----------|-------------|
| `image` | JPEG bytes | Yes | A single-frame JPEG image; decoded into an image frame on the server side |

> Note: The current server implementation strictly depends on the `image` field.

---

**Response Format**

- Status: `200 OK`
- Body: `OK`

---

**Common HTTP Status Codes**

| HTTP Status | Body | Meaning |
|-------------|------|---------|
| 503 | `ingest disabled` | Ingest is OFF in the PC Dashboard |
| 400 | `missing image` | `image` field not provided (or incorrect field name) |
| 400 | `decode failed` | Image bytes could not be decoded (corrupted / not JPEG) |
| Network Error | Timeout / connection failed | IP/Port incorrect, firewall issue, different subnet |

---

**curl Example**

```bash
curl -i -X POST "http://<PC_IP>:<PORT>/upload" \
  -F "image=@frame.jpg;type=image/jpeg"
```

---

#### 4.2.4. Video Stream Endpoint: `GET /stream`

> Note: This endpoint is primarily used by the Sentinel Dashboard.
It is typically embedded via: `<img src="/stream">`. CamFlow itself does not actively call this endpoint.

---

**Request**

- Method: `GET`
- Path: `/stream`
- Body: None

**Response Format**

- Content-Type: `multipart/x-mixed-replace; boundary=frame`
- Data Format: Continuous MJPEG frame stream

**curl Example**

```bash
curl -v "http://<PC_IP>:<PORT>/stream"
```
---

#### 4.2.5. UDP Auto Discovery Protocol

CamFlow supports automatic server discovery within the same local network to simplify first-time deployment.

**Protocol Parameters**

- Transport: UDP
- Discovery Port: `37020`
- Server Bind Address: `0.0.0.0:37020` (listen on all network interfaces)

---

**Client Broadcast Request**

CamFlow sends a UTF-8 text broadcast packet: `FIND_PHONECAM_SERVER`

---

**Server Response**

When the server receives the broadcast request, it replies via UDP unicast: `PHONECAM_SERVER http://<PC_IP>:<PORT>`

Where:

- `<PORT>` is the HTTP service port (used for `/ping`, `/upload`, `/stream`);
- `<PC_IP>` is inferred based on the sender’s IP address to increase reachability in multi-network-interface environments.

---

**Protocol Interaction Flow**

```bash
CamFlow (Android)
    │
    │ UDP Broadcast → 255.255.255.255:37020
    │ Payload: "FIND_PHONECAM_SERVER"
    ▼
Sentinel PC (UDP listener on port 37020)
    │
    │ UDP Unicast Response → sender
    │ Payload: "PHONECAM_SERVER http://<IP>:<PORT>"
    ▼
CamFlow
    │
    │ Parse Base URL
    │ → Execute GET /ping
    │ → If OK, start POST /upload loop
